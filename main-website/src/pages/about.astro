        Adab is more than etiquette — it’s the art of how we speak, how we listen, and how we carry ourselves. 
        In Urdu literature, adab runs through every line of verse, every gathering at a mushaira, every moment 
        when a poet picks up the pen. We wanted to bring that soul into what you wear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our pieces are inspired by classical Urdu poetry: the ghazal, the nazm, the couplets that have moved 
        generations. Each design carries a verse — sometimes loud on the chest, sometimes tucked in like a 
        secret. The words are in Nastaliq, in script that feels like breath on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re not a fashion label that uses Urdu as a trend. We’re a label that starts from the verse. 
        From the culture of mehfils and mushairas, from the weight of a single word. Streetwear that 
        doesn’t shout — it speaks.
