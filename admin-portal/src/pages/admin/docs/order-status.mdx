# Order status

Quick reference for how order statuses work and which changes you can make in the Orders screen. If you try an invalid change, you’ll see an error like *"Invalid status transition from X to Y"*.

---

## What each status means

- **PENDING** 📋 — Order just placed; not confirmed yet.
- **CONFIRMED** ✓ — Order has been confirmed.
- **PROCESSING** 📦 — Order is being prepared or packed.
- **SHIPPED** 🚚 — Order has been shipped.
- **DELIVERED** ✅ — Order has been delivered. *(Final state.)*
- **CANCELLED** ❌ — Order was cancelled. *(Final state.)*

You can cancel an order from **PENDING**, **CONFIRMED**, **PROCESSING**, or **SHIPPED**. Once an order is **DELIVERED** or **CANCELLED**, you can’t change it to anything else.

---

## Normal flow 📈

Typical path an order follows:

**PENDING** → **CONFIRMED** → **PROCESSING** → **SHIPPED** → **DELIVERED**

You can also move forward in bigger steps (e.g. PENDING → SHIPPED) when it makes sense. Staying on the same status (e.g. PENDING → PENDING) is always allowed.

---

## Allowed changes (valid transitions) ✓

From any status you can keep it the same. From the statuses below you can also move to the ones listed.

- **PENDING** → CONFIRMED, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, or CANCELLED
- **CONFIRMED** → PROCESSING, SHIPPED, or CANCELLED
- **PROCESSING** → SHIPPED or CANCELLED
- **SHIPPED** → DELIVERED or CANCELLED
- **DELIVERED** → no further changes 🏁
- **CANCELLED** → no further changes 🏁

---

## Disallowed changes (invalid transitions) ⚠️

These changes will show an error if you try them:

- **PENDING** — Cannot jump straight to DELIVERED.
- **CONFIRMED** — Cannot go back to PENDING or jump to DELIVERED.
- **PROCESSING** — Cannot go back to PENDING or CONFIRMED, or jump to DELIVERED.
- **SHIPPED** — Cannot go back to PENDING, CONFIRMED, or PROCESSING.
- **DELIVERED** — Cannot change to any other status (terminal).
- **CANCELLED** — Cannot change to any other status (terminal).

Once an order is **DELIVERED** or **CANCELLED**, the only “transition” allowed is leaving it as-is.
