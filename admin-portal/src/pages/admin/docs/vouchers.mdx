# Vouchers & Coupons

Guide for creating and managing discount vouchers (coupon codes) that customers can use at checkout.

---

## Overview

Vouchers let you offer discounts to customers. They enter a code at checkout and the discount is applied automatically. You can create vouchers with different discount types, set usage limits, and restrict them to certain products or categories.

**Where to manage vouchers:** [Admin → Vouchers](/admin/vouchers)

---

## Voucher types

| Type | How it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Percentage off** | Reduces the order subtotal by a percentage (e.g. 20% off). You can optionally cap the maximum discount amount. |
| **Fixed amount off** | Reduces the order subtotal by a fixed amount in PKR (e.g. 500 PKR off). |
| **Free shipping** | Waives the delivery fee. Useful when your settings charge for shipping. |

---

## Creating a voucher

1. Go to **Vouchers** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Create voucher**.
3. Fill in the form:

### Code
- A unique code customers will type at checkout (e.g. `SUMMER20`, `WELCOME100`).
- Codes are case-insensitive (SUMMER20 = summer20).
- Use **Generate** to create a random 8-character code.

### Type & value
- **Percentage off** — Value is 1–100 (e.g. 20 = 20% off).
- **Fixed amount off** — Value is in PKR (e.g. 500 = 500 PKR off).
- **Free shipping** — No value needed.

### Min order value (PKR)
- Minimum cart subtotal required for the voucher to apply.
- Leave 0 for no minimum.

### Max discount cap (Percentage only)
- Limits how much the percentage discount can be (in PKR).
- Example: 20% off with a 1000 PKR cap — a 10,000 PKR order gets 1000 PKR off, not 2000 PKR.
- Leave empty for no cap.

### Start & expiry dates
- When the voucher becomes valid and when it stops working.
- Use date and time for precise control.

### Usage limits
- **Usage limit (global)** — Maximum number of times the voucher can be used in total.
- **Usage limit (per user)** — Maximum times each customer can use it (requires customer to be logged in at checkout).
- Leave empty for unlimited.

### Eligible products & categories
- **Empty** — Voucher applies to all products.
- **Select specific products** — Only those products count toward the discount.
- **Select specific categories** — Only products in those categories count.

Use this to run targeted promotions (e.g. “20% off accessories only”).

## Status & lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | Voucher can be used (within date range and usage limits). |
| **Upcoming** | Start date has not been reached yet. |
| **Expired** | Expiry date has passed or usage limit reached. |
| **Deactivated** | Manually turned off. Won’t work even if dates are valid. |

Use **Activate** / **Deactivate** to turn vouchers on or off without changing dates.

---

## Filters & search

On the Vouchers list you can:

- **Search by code** — Find a voucher by typing part of its code.
- **Filter by status** — All, Active, Expired, or Upcoming.
- **Sort** — By date created, code, expiry, or number of uses.

---

## Analytics (Stats)

Click **Stats** on a voucher to see:

- **Total redemptions** — How many orders used this voucher.
- **Revenue impact** — Total discount amount given (in PKR).
- **Remaining uses** — How many times it can still be used (if there’s a limit).

---

## Tips

1. **Short, memorable codes** — `SUMMER20` is easier for customers than `XK9Q2P7M`.
2. **Set a minimum order** — Helps avoid abuse and increases average order value.
3. **Use per-user limits** — For “first order” or “once per customer” promos.
4. **Test before launch** — Create a test voucher, apply it at checkout, then deactivate it.
5. **Deactivate instead of delete** — Keeps history; you can reactivate later if needed.

## Customer experience

At checkout, customers:

1. See a **Voucher code** field in the order summary.
2. Enter the code and click **Apply**.
3. See the discount reflected immediately.
4. Can click **Remove** to clear it.

If the voucher is invalid, expired, or doesn’t apply to their cart, they see a clear error message (e.g. “This voucher has expired” or “Minimum order value of 1000 PKR required”).
